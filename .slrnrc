%
%% 1. Tell slrn about your identity (name, email address and such)
%

% The "From:" header will be generated from the following three variables.
% With the example settings, it would read "john@doe.com (John Doe)".
set username		"cr3"
set hostname		"nospam.interunion.ca"
set realname		"Marc Tardif"

% Set this if you want replies to your articles to go to a address different
% from the one in "From:".
%set replyto		"marc@interunion.ca"

% What to put into the "Organization:" header line.
set organization	"Interunion"

% The name of your signature file.  If "", no signature is added.
set signature		".signature"

%
%% 2. Server specific settings
%

% This can either be set to "nntp" (read online) or "spool" (use local spool)
set server_object	"spool"

% This can be "nntp" (post directly to the server), "inews" (use external
% program for posting) or "slrnpull" (spool message for slrnpull to send).
set post_object		"slrnpull"

% Set this to zero if you want to leave Message-ID generation to your server
% or your system does not have a proper unique hostname.
set generate_message_id 1

% If non-zero, slrn reads the active file on each startup.  You might want to
% use this if your network connection is fast or the server has few groups.
set read_active 1

% The following variables are only meaningful when using spool mode:

% Basic directory settings
set spool_inn_root	"/home/cr3/.slrnpull"
set spool_root		"/home/cr3/.slrnpull/news"
set spool_nov_root	"/home/cr3/.slrnpull/over.view"

% These are relative to spool_inn_root unless they start with "/".
%set spool_active_file "data/active"
%set spool_activetimes_file "data/active.times"
%set spool_newsgroups_file "data/newsgroups"

% This value is relative to the directories under spool_nov_root:
%set spool_nov_file ".overview"

% Whether to check for each article when reading an overview file (slower,
% but may save you from lots of "article not available" errors).
%set spool_check_up_on_nov 0

%
%% 3. Which external programs do you want to use?
%

% Note OS/2 and Win32 users: 
%   To separate directories you can either use a single '/' or
%   double '\\'. Single backslashes are not supported.  For example, use
%   "C:\\home\\file.txt" or "C:/home/file.txt" but NOT "C:\home\file.txt"

% Set your favourite editor.  Use %s for the file name and %d for the line
% where the cursor should be placed (usually at the beginning of the body).
set editor_command "vim -f +%d '%s'"

% You can have separate commands for editing posts, mail, and score files.
set mail_editor_command "mutt -H '%s'"
set post_editor_command "mutt -H '%s'"
set score_editor_command "vim '%s'" % /home/cr3/.slrn/scoring"

% If non-zero, abort posting or email operation if the file was not modified
% by the editor.
set abort_unmodified_edits 1

% In case we need metamail to display an article:
set metamail_command "metamail"

% WWW browser to use. Xbrowser is used when the DISPLAY environment variable
% is set; non_Xbrowser otherwise.
set non_Xbrowser "lynx '%s'"
%set Xbrowser "netscape '%s' &"

% Command to use for printing
% Note: On Win32, this variable defines the name of the printer queue to use.
%set printer_name "lpr -Plp"

% In case you want to use another mailer than sendmail.  Be sure that it
% implements the same interface, though!
%set sendmail_command "/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t -oem -odb"

% Set this to one if you want the "From:" header in e-mails to be generated
% from the hostname / username / realname variable.
% Note: Not all MTAs are configured to allow this.
%set generate_email_from 0

%
%% 4. Directory / file names
%

% Note: All filenames in this section are relative to HOME unless they start
%       with a '/'.

% Filename where articles / email you sent are archived.
% Note: If these are unset, slrn does not keep a copy of outgoing messages.
set save_posts "news/posts"
set save_replies "news/replies"

% File where failed posts are appended.  Use "" to disable saving.
%set failed_posts_file "dead.letter"

% Name of score file.
set scorefile "news/score"

% Name of directory where decoded files are placed.
set decode_directory "news"
  
% Directory where all other files are saved.
set save_directory "news"

% Directory where postponed articles are placed. Please make sure it exists.
set postpone_directory "news/postponed"

% Whether to put temporary files for postings, followups and replies in the
% directory specified by the TMPDIR environment variable or /tmp.
%set use_tmpdir 0

%
%% 5. Attribution lines / custom headers
%

% This sets the attribution lines for follow-ups and replies.  The following
% format specifiers are recognized:
%  %d:date, %D:date (formatted), %r:real name, %R:first name,
%  %f:email address, %s:subject, %m:msgid, %n:newsgroups, %%: percent
%set followup_string "On %D, %r <%f> wrote:"
%set reply_string "In %n, you wrote:"

% Custom headers to add to *new* posts
%set custom_headers "Mail-Copies-To: nobody"

% Custom headers for followup/reply/supersedes.  These can use format
% specifiers as in the 'followup_string' variable.
%set followup_custom_headers "Mail-Copies-To: nobody"
%set reply_custom_headers "X-newsgroup: %n\nX-realname: %r"
%set supersedes_custom_headers "X-Superseded-Date: %d"

% These are inserted when sending email CCs of your postings.
% cc_post_string currently does not support any % escapes.
%set cc_followup_string "[This message has also been posted to %n.]"
%set cc_post_string "[This message has also been posted.]"

%
%% 6. Character mapping / MIME support
%

% Character set used for the local display; valid values are:
%   isolatin, ibm850, ibm852, next, koi8
%set charset isolatin

% Character set to declare when posting 8bit characters. Do *not* use
% the same value as for "charset" here.
%set mime_charset "iso-8859-1"

% You may set this to a comma-separated list of MIME charsets your terminal
% is capable to display. The example adds two Chinese charsets:
%compatible_charsets "Big5,gb2312"

% If non-zero, call metamail for MIME formats slrn cannot handle.
%set use_metamail 1

%
%% 7. Some preferences for the header window (see the manual for more)
%

% These sorting methods are available:
% If 0, do not sort.  If 1, perform threading.  If 2, sort by subject.
% If 3, thread then sort result by subject.
% If 4, sort by score.  If 5, thread then sort by score.
% If 6, sort by score and subject.
% If 7, thread, then sort by score and subject.
% If 8, sort by date with most recent first.
% If 9, thread, then sort by date with most recent first.
% If 10, sort by date with most recent last.
% If 11, thread then sort by date with most recent last.
%set sorting_method 3

% If non-zero, a header with a new subject will start a new thread.
%set new_subject_breaks_threads 0

%
%% 8. Some preferences for the article pager (see the manual for more)
%

% Which headers do you want to see by default?
% You can also match all headers starting with a given string and exclude
% specific headers by preceding them with "!" (e.g. use "X-,!X-Trace:" to
% display all the "X-"headers except "X-Trace:").
%visible_headers "From:,Subject:,Newsgroups:,Followup-To:,Reply-To:"

% If non-zero, #v+ and #v- will be interpreted as markers of verbatim lines.
%set process_verbatim_marks	1

% If non-zero, hide #v+/#v- verbatim marks.
%set hide_verbatim_marks 0
  
% If non-zero, hide signature in articles.
set hide_signature		1

% If non-zero, hide PGP signature in articles.
set hide_pgpsignature		1

set auto_mark_article_as_read	0
set query_read_group_cutoff	1000
set confirm_actions		0
