Habit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind. This chapter is about setting
long-term goals based on "true-north principles". Covey recommends to
formulate a "personal mission statement" to document one's perception of
one's own purpose in life. He sees visualization as an important tool
to develop this. He also deals with organizational mission statements,
which he claims to be more effective if developed and supported by all
members of an organization, rather than being prescribed.

tasks that appear to be urgent, but are in fact less important. Delegation
is presented as an important part of time management. Successful
delegation, according to Covey, focuses on results and benchmarks that are
to be agreed in advance, rather than on prescribing detailed work plans.
